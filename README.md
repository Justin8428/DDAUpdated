# DDAUpdated
Updated version of DDA

Original exe from mk77ch "Mike" at http://www.surfaceforums.net/threads/wheres-the-dim-display-after-power-setting-in-windows-8-1.6577/

TODO:
 - retain option to set brightness manually
 - better icon
 - make it monitor independent (record events only if on particular monitor), not sure if possible or easy in Windows (native is LASTINPUTINFO)
